/* Hunting the KINDS of fault this app keeps producing.
 *
 * Almost every real bug found on 2026-09-04 was found by BZ looking at a
 * screen: an id that did not exist, a field parsed and then dropped, a
 * state key that never synced, a literal \u2014 in a string, a dead
 * function left behind. Every one of those is visible in the source
 * without running anything — the suite could not see them because it
 * tests behaviour through L, and these live in the wiring.
 *
 * This reads index.html as text and asks the questions that would have
 * caught them.
